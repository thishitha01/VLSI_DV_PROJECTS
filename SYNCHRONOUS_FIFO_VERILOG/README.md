⚡ Synchronous FIFO in Verilog

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Synchronous FIFO (First-In First-Out) memory using Verilog.
The FIFO is designed with configurable depth and word size, and verified using Synopsys VCS with extensive simulation.

🎯 Key Features

✅ Synchronous FIFO design with read/write operations

✅ Full & Empty flag implementation

✅ Handles simultaneous read/write conditions

✅ Corner-case verification (underflow, overflow)

✅ Waveform validation on Synopsys VCS

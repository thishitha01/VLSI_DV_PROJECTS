⚡16-bit Multiplier with Assertions & Coverage
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a 16-bit multiplier in SystemVerilog and verifies it using assertions and functional coverage.
The focus was on verification methodology to ensure correctness under all possible scenarios.

🎯 Key Features
✅ RTL design in SystemVerilog
✅ Verification with assertions (checking correctness and stability)
✅ Achieved 100% functional coverage 
✅ Simulated using QuestaSim for waveform analysis & coverage reports
✅ Edge case handling for signed/unsigned inputs

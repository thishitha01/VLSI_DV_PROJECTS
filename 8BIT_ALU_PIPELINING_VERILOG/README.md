⚡ 8-bit ALU with Pipelining

📌 Project Overview

This project implements an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog with pipelining to improve throughput.
The design supports multiple arithmetic and logical operations, and was verified using Synopsys VCS with functional simulation and waveform analysis.

🎯 Key Features

✅ RTL design in Verilog

✅ Implements core operations: Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, etc.

✅ 3-stage pipelining for higher performance

✅ Comprehensive testbench for validation

✅ Achieved successful simulation on Synopsys VCS

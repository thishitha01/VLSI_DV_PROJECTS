⚡ VLSI & Digital Design Projects

Welcome to my repository of VLSI and Digital Design projects.
This repo contains a collection of RTL designs, verification testbenches, and simulations done using Verilog/SystemVerilog and industry-standard tools like Synopsys VCS.

📌 Contents

**1.** Synchronous FIFO (Verilog + VCS)

**2.** 8-bit ALU with Pipelining (Verilog)

**3.** 16-bit Multiplier with Assertions & Coverage (SystemVerilog + QuestaSim)

🛠️ Tools & Skills

HDLs: Verilog, SystemVerilog

Simulation Tools: Synopsys VCS, QuestaSim

Verification: Assertions, Functional Coverage, Directed & Random Testing

Concepts: Pipelining, FIFO, Arithmetic Circuits, Testbench Development

🌟 Highlights

✅ RTL coding + complete testbenches

✅ Functional & corner-case verification

✅ 100% functional coverage achieved for some designs

✅ Organized project structure for easy navigation

🚀 Future Work

I will keep adding more digital design + verification projects here, covering:

Protocol-based designs (UART, I2C, etc.)

UVM-based verification environments
